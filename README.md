# Baby Name Chooser

This is a private project designed to help my family democratically choose a name for our soon-to-be-born child. Family members can propose names and vote on them, making the process of choosing a baby name fun and inclusive.

Please note that this repository is not intended for public use or contribution. It's simply here for reference.

## Features

- **Propose Names**: Family members can propose a new name for consideration.
- **Vote on Names**: Family members can select how much they like every name.
- **User Profiles**: Each family member has a user profile with a color identifier.
- **Ranking**: There is a section to see the trending names, ranked by a custom function that weights average and total points and penalizes large standard deviations.

Thank you for your interest!
